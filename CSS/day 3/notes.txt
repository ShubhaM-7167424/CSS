By default if position is not mentioned it means it is position static
- in static position z-index is not allowed
- neither top bottom left right

relative - element will be always positioned according to its original place

absolute - is positioned according to either the nearest positioned ancestor
                 or to the viewport

fixed   - is always positioned according to viewport
        - is not scrollable

sticky - will be scrollable and also fixed at some point


absolute and fixed are some what similar the only difference is fixed doesn't move

relative and sticky are some what similar the only difference is sticky will be 
fixed when the given position is acheived
